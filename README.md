# Password-criteria

This is one of my first tasks during my beginner Java course. <br>
<br>
This is a function that verifies the password created by the user. The criteria is that it has to contain at least one:
     number 0-9, one uppercase, one lowercase and one character that is not number or letter. It also must be at least 8 characters.
     For the program to know when a criteria is met, I use boolean values to be set to true.
     If all booleans are true, method will return true.
